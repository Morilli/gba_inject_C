# gba_inject_C
A port of the python gba injector in C

All credits for the idea, general concept etc. goes to the maker of https://github.com/ajd4096/inject_gba.
I've tried to make my program more efficient and more specialized on the injection itself, instead of virtually creating a multi-functional toolbox for psb files.
Code is relatively messy and potentially unclean, although I've tried to do the best I can to keep stuff kinda manageable.

I have the mentioned .psb.m, .bin and .gba files from the command.txt file on my pc, although I will not be sharing them in this repository.
